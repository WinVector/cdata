As part of our consulting practice [Win-Vector LLC](http://www.win-vector.com/) has been helping
a few clients stand-up advanced analytics and machine learning stacks  using [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) and 
substantial data stores (such as relational database variants such as `PostgreSQL` or big data systems such as `Spark`).

Often we come to a point where we or a partner realize: "the design would be a whole lot easier if we could phrase it in terms of higher order data operators."

The `R` package [`DBI`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DBI) gives us direct 
access to `SQL` and the package [`dplyr`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr)
gives us access to a transform grammar that can either be executed or translated into `SQL`.

But, as we point out in the [`replyr`](https://winvector.github.io/replyr/) [`README`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/replyr/README.html): moving from in-memory `R`
to large data systems is always a bit of a shock as you lose a lot of your higher order data
operators or transformations.  Missing operators include:

  * union (binding by rows many data frames into a single data frame).
  * split (splitting a single data frame into many data frames).
  * pivot (moving row values into columns).
  * un-pivot (moving column values to rows).

I can repeat this.
If you are an `R` user used to using one of 
`dplyr::bind_rows()` , `base::split()`, `tidyr::spread()`, or `tidyr::gather()`:
you will find these functions do not work on remote data sources, but have
replacement implementations in the `replyr` package.



For example:

```{r dbex1}
library("RPostgreSQL")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("dplyr"))
isSpark <- FALSE

# Can work with PostgreSQL
my_db <- DBI::dbConnect(dbDriver("PostgreSQL"),
                        host = 'localhost',
                        port = 5432,
                        user = 'postgres',
                        password = 'pg')
 
# # Can work with Sparklyr
# my_db <-  sparklyr::spark_connect(version='2.2.0', 
#                                   master = "local")
# isSpark <- TRUE

d <- dplyr::copy_to(my_db, data.frame(x =  c(1,5), 
                                      group = c('g1', 'g2'),
                                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE), 
                    'd')
print(d)
```

```{r dbd1, error=TRUE}
# show dplyr::bind_rows() fails.
dplyr::bind_rows(list(d, d))
```

The `replyr` package supplies `R` accessible 
implementations of these missing operators
for large data systems such as `PostgreSQL` and `Spark`.

For example:

```{r replyrex}
# using the development version of replyr https://github.com/WinVector/replyr
library("replyr") 
packageVersion("replyr")

# binding rows
dB <- replyr_bind_rows(list(d, d))
print(dB)

# splitting frames
replyr_split(dB, 'group')

# pivoting
pivotControl <- 
  cdata::buildPivotControlTableN('d', 
                                 columnToTakeKeysFrom = 'group', 
                                 columnToTakeValuesFrom = 'x',
                                 sep = '_',
                                 my_db = my_db)
dWname <- 
  cdata::moveValuesToColumnsN(keyColumns = NULL,
                              controlTable = pivotControl,
                              tallTable = 'd',
                              my_db = my_db, strict = FALSE) 
dW <- dplyr::tbl(my_db, dWname)
print(dW)
                     

# un-pivoting
unpivotControl <- 
  cdata::buildUnPivotControlTable(nameForNewKeyColumn = 'group',
                                  nameForNewValueColumn = 'x',
                                  columnsToTakeFrom = colnames(dW))
dXname <- 
  cdata::moveValuesToRowsN(controlTable = unpivotControl,
                           wideTable = dWname,
                           my_db = my_db)
dX <- dplyr::tbl(my_db, dXname)
print(dX)
```

The point is: using the `replyr` package you *can* design in terms of higher-order data transforms, even 
when working with big data in `R`.  Designs in terms of these operators tend to 
be succinct, powerful, performant, and maintainable.  

To master the terms `moveValuesToRows` and `moveValuesToColumns` I suggest trying the following
two articles:

  * [Theory of coordinatized data](https://github.com/WinVector/cdata/blob/master/extras/RowsAndColumns.md).
  * [Fluid data transforms](https://github.com/WinVector/cdata/blob/master/extras/FluidData.md).

```{r cleanup}
if(isSpark) {
  status <- sparklyr::spark_disconnect(my_db)
} else {
  status <- DBI::dbDisconnect(my_db)
}
my_db <- NULL
```
