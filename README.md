`cdata` is a running explanation of the ["coordinatized data" theory](https://github.com/WinVector/cdata/blob/master/extras/RowsAndColumns.md) and includes an implementation of the ["fluid data" methodology](https://github.com/WinVector/cdata/blob/master/extras/FluidData.md).

Install via CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("cdata")
```

Or from Github using devtools:

``` r
devtools::install_github("WinVector/cdata")
```

Note: `cdata` is targeted at data with "tame column names", that is column names that are valid both in databases, and as `R` variable names.
