# Block Records and Row Records

The theory of [`cdata`](https://winvector.github.io/cdata/) data transforms is based on the principles:

  * data has coordinates 
  * data is naturally grouped into records.
  
The idea of data coordinates is related to [Codd's 2nd rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codd%27s_12_rules): 
  
> Each and every datum (atomic value) in a relational data base is guaranteed to be logically accessible by resorting to a combination of table name, primary key value and column name.

The coordinatized data concept is that the exact *current* data realization is incidental.  One can perform a data *change of basis* to get the data into the right format (where the physical layout of records is altered to match the desired logical layout of the data).

The idea of data records (and these records possibly being different than simple rows) is a staple of computer science: harking at least back to [record-oriented filesystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record-oriented_filesystem), and perhaps living on in JSON nested format.

The entirety of the `cdata` package is to supply transforms between what we call "row records" (records that
happen to be implemented as a single row) and block records (records that span multiple rows).  These two
methods are:

  * `cdata::rowrecs_to_blocks()`
  * `cdata::blocks_to_rowrecs()`
  
All the other `cdata` functions are helpers allowing abbreviated notation in special cases (such as `unpivot_to_blocks()` `pivot_to_rowrecs()`) and adapters (allowing these operations to be performed directly in databases and large data systems such as `Apache Spark`).


Let's look at `cdata` with some specific data.

For our example let's take the task of re-organizing the `iris` data for a faceted plot, as
discussed [here](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2018/10/faceted-graphs-with-cdata-and-ggplot2/).

```{r}
library(cdata)

iris <- data.frame(iris)
iris$iris_id <- seq_len(nrow(iris))

head(iris, n=1)
```

To transform this data into a format ready for our `ggplot2` task we design (as [taught here](https://winvector.github.io/cdata/articles/design.html)) a "transform control table" that shows how to move from our row-oriented form into a block oriented form. Which in this case
looks like the following.

In `R` the transform table is specified as follows.

```{r}
(controlTable <- wrapr::qchar_frame(
  flower_part, Length      , Width       |
  Petal      , Petal.Length, Petal.Width |
  Sepal      , Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width ))

columnsToCopy <- "Species"
```

And then applying it converts rows from our `iris` data into ready to plot 2-row blocks.

```{r}
iris_aug <- rowrecs_to_blocks(
  head(iris, n=1),
  controlTable,
  columnsToCopy = columnsToCopy)

iris_aug
```

To perform the reverse transform we use the same transform control table, but we think of it as specifying the reverse transform (from its own block form into a row).

<img src="blocks_to_rowrecs.png" width="600">

We also use additional keys to help us identify the which rows are in the same block record (in this case the `iris_id` column).  

A forward and then back transform is as follows.

```{r}
columnsToCopy = qc(iris_id, Species)

# re-do the forward transform, this time
# with the iris_id
iris_aug <- rowrecs_to_blocks(
  head(iris, n=3),
  controlTable,
  columnsToCopy = columnsToCopy)

iris_aug

# demonstrate the reverse transform
iris_back <- blocks_to_rowrecs(
  iris_aug,
  keyColumns = c("iris_id", "Species"),
  controlTable
)

iris_back
```

Notice we use the same control table in both directions: what changes is the interpretations of various regions of the control table.

The  control table is a picture of the transform in the sense that it transforms it self
into a row, and that row back into itself.  We show this here.

```{r}
# transform the row into a control table
row <- blocks_to_rowrecs(controlTable, 
                         keyColumns = NULL, 
                         controlTable = controlTable)
print(row)

# recover the controlTable from the row
rowrecs_to_blocks(row,
                  controlTable = controlTable)
```


`cdata` considers the row-record a universal form.  Just about any data shape can be transformed to any other by:

 * (optionally) Combining columns (as new column names in the soon to come row records must come from values of a single column).
 * Performing a `blocks_to_rowrecs()` step (moving all data for each arbitrarily shaped block record into a single row).
 * Performing a `rowrecs_to_blocks()` step (moving all data from each row into a *new* arbitrarily shaped block record).
 * (optionally) Splitting some columns (as only a single inside block key column is produced by `rowrecs_to_blocks()`, this step us not often needed).
 
For most practical applications we have seen a single `blocks_to_rowrecs()` step or `rowrecs_to_blocks()` step is usually sufficient.

This differs from `reshape2` where the `melt()` to "molten" (or thin [RDF-triple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple)-like) is used as the universal intermediate form that one then `dcast()`s into desired arrangements.

The act of [designing a transform control table](https://winvector.github.io/cdata/articles/design.html) to solve a problem already exposes a lot of problem structure:

 * If the control table has two columns then the operation could be implemented as a single `tidyr` `gather()` or `spread()`.
 * If the control table has `k` rows then the `rowrecs_to_blocks()` direction could be implemented as `k-1` `rbind()`s.

As we have said, a tutorial on *how* to design a `controlTable` can be found [here](https://winvector.github.io/cdata/articles/design.html).

# Appendix

The `cdata` operators can be related to Codd's relational operators as follows:

  * `rowrecs_to_blocks()` is a variation of a relational-join of the data with the control table.  This is why you get one row per pair of original data rows and control table rows.
  * `blocks_to_rowrecs()` is essentially an aggregation or relational-projection (actually even a coalesce) over a widened table.  This is why this operation decreases the number of rows.
