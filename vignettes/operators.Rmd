As of `cdata` version `1.0.8` `cdata` implements an operator notation for data transform.

The idea is simple, yet powerful.  In fact it helps us find new names for the transforms: *multiply* to block records and *factor* to row records.  These terms will become clear as we work examples.

First let's start with some data.

```{r}

d <- wrapr::build_frame(
   "model_id"  , "measure", "value" |
     1         , "AUC"    , 0.7     |
     1         , "R2"     , 0.4     |
     2         , "AUC"    , 0.8     |
     2         , "R2"     , 0.5     )

knitr::kable(d)
```

In the above data we have two measurements each for two individuals (individuals identified by the "`model_id`" column).  Using `cdata`'s `rowrecs_to_blocks_spec()` method we can capture a description of this record structure and transformation details.

```{r}
library("cdata")

transform <- rowrecs_to_blocks_spec(
  wrapr::qchar_frame(
    "measure", "value" |
    "AUC"    , AUC     |
    "R2"     , R2      ),
  recordKeys = "model_id")

print(transform)
```

Once we have this specification we can transform the data using operator notation.

We can collect the record blocks into rows by a "factor-out" (or aggregation/projection) step.

```{r}
knitr::kable(d)

d2 <- d %//% t(transform)

knitr::kable(d2)
```

We can expand record rows into blocks by a "multiplication" (or join) step.

```{r}
knitr::kable(d2)

d3 <- d2 %**% transform

knitr::kable(d3)
```

(`%//%` and `%**%` being two operators introduced by the `cdata` package.)

And the two operators have an inverse/adjoint relation.

```{r}
knitr::kable(d)

# identity
d4 <- d %//% t(transform) %**% transform

knitr::kable(d4)
```


We can also pipe into the spec (and into its adjoint) using the [`wrapr`](https://github.com/WinVector/wrapr) [`dot pipe operator`](https://winvector.github.io/wrapr/reference/dot_arrow.html).

```{r}
# reverse or adjoint/transpose operation specification
t_record_spec <- t(transform)

d %.>% 
  t_record_spec %.>%
  knitr::kable(.)

# using dot-pipe's bquote style .() execute immediate notation
d %.>% 
  .(t(transform)) %.>%
  knitr::kable(.)

# identity
d %.>% 
  .(t(transform)) %.>% 
  transform %.>%
  knitr::kable(.)
```

And, of course, the exact same functionality for database tables.

```{r}
have_db <- requireNamespace("DBI", quietly = TRUE) &&
   requireNamespace("RSQLite", quietly = TRUE)
```

```{r eval=have_db}
raw_connection <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), 
                                 ":memory:")
RSQLite::initExtension(raw_connection)
db <- rquery::rquery_db_info(
  connection = raw_connection,
  is_dbi = TRUE,
  connection_options = rquery::rq_connection_tests(raw_connection))

d_td <- rquery::rq_copy_to(db, "d", d)
```

```{r eva=have_db}
ops <- d_td %//% t(transform)
cat(format(ops))

rquery::execute(db, ops) %.>%
  knitr::kable(.)

d_td %.>% 
  .(t(transform)) %.>%
  rquery::execute(db, .) %.>%
  knitr::kable(.)
```


```{r eval=have_db}
DBI::dbDisconnect(raw_connection)
```


And that is truly fluid data manipulation.
