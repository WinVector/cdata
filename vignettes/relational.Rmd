The `cdata` operators have some interesting lineage:

  * `rowrecs_to_blocks()` is a variation of a relational-join of the data with the control table.  This is why you get one row per pair of original data rows and control table rows.
  * `blocks_to_rowrecs()` is essentially an aggregation or relational-projection (actually even a coalesce) over a widened table.  This is why this operation decreases the number of rows.
  * The `controlTable` is a picture of one side of the transform (and a wide row is the other).
  
The sense we mean the control table is a picture of the transform from 
["plotting the `iris` data faceted"](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2018/10/faceted-graphs-with-cdata-and-ggplot2/)
is made a bit more obvious if we apply the control table to itself.

```{r}
library(cdata)

iris <- data.frame(iris)


(controlTable <- wrapr::qchar_frame(
  flower_part, Length      , Width       |
  Petal      , Petal.Length, Petal.Width |
  Sepal      , Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width ))

row <- blocks_to_rowrecs(controlTable, 
                         keyColumns = NULL, 
                         controlTable = controlTable)
print(row)

# recover the controlTable from the row!
rowrecs_to_blocks(row,
                  controlTable = controlTable)
```

Some discussion of this example and the theory of records in `cdata` can be found [here](https://winvector.github.io/cdata/articles/blocksrecs.html).
